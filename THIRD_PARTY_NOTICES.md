# Third-party notices

This repository bundles software and fonts written by other people. Their licences are
reproduced or pointed to below, and their copyright notices are preserved as those licences
require. The pack's own material — the seven deck templates, the seven brand presets, the
contact sheets, and `install.py` — is [MIT © 2026 humanist96](LICENSE).

## PPT Master workflow — `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/`, `requirements.txt`, `projects/`

The whole SVG-authoring → native-PPTX pipeline vendored into this repository comes from
**[byungjunjang/slide-master](https://github.com/byungjunjang/slide-master)**, itself a Korean-workflow
customisation of **[hugohe3/ppt-master](https://github.com/hugohe3/ppt-master)**. Both are MIT.

Vendored at slide-master `main`, 2026-08-04. Files are byte-identical to upstream except where
this repository's own README, docs index, and template library extend them; upstream's own README
is kept verbatim at [`docs/slide-master-README.md`](docs/slide-master-README.md).

Two skills vendored under `.claude/skills/` carry their own `LICENSE` file alongside their
`SKILL.md` — `codex-image` and `diagram-design`. Those files are unmodified; read them there.

## Bundled template libraries

`.claude/skills/ppt-master/templates/` ships upstream's deck and brand templates
(`apple`, `jangpm`, `mckinsey`, `naver_ir`; `anthropic`, `apple`, `google`, `jangpm`,
`mckinsey`, `naver`) plus upstream's icon and chart libraries. They arrive under the MIT
licence above. Where a template names a company it identifies a design *idiom* as a reference
point — descriptive comparison, not a claim of endorsement or affiliation. See
[`TRADEMARKS.md`](TRADEMARKS.md).

**KoPub돋움체 (KoPub Dotum)** — `.claude/skills/ppt-master/templates/decks/koscom-chevron/fonts/`

Details and the family/weight mapping:
[`fonts/FONTS.md`](.claude/skills/ppt-master/templates/decks/koscom-chevron/fonts/FONTS.md).

Neither font is embedded in an exported `.pptx` — PowerPoint does not embed fonts through this
pipeline. Install them wherever a deck is opened.
